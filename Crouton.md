Crouton has some nifty advantages:

All the advantages of Chromebook hardware
- Device state (on? off? asleep? awake? hibernating?) is no longer a concern. Just clost the lid when you are done, and open it when you are ready to resume work.
- If you do need to reboot, the process takes seconds.
- Lightweight hardware and a battery that lasts all day.

All the advantages of ChromeOS
- ChromeOS is just a button press away. Crouton's ability to
  simultaneously run both platforms is an advantage over the dual-boot
method of bringing linux to Chromebook hardware.
- This encourages you to use ChromeOS for what it does well -HTML5 desktop app platform- and to optimize your Crouton system around things that it does better like software development.
- Google Apps. I use ChromeOS to interact with Google apps and my google account.
- Chrome Tools/Apps. I also use the Chrome side to run Chrome Store apps that I've come to enjoy, like Caret, WriteBox, and Chrome Developer Tools.

Crouton has some drawbacks:

- It's built on ubuntu version 12, which isn't new.
- Not everything works correctly yet, although overall it's remarkably usable and complete. ChromeOS Keyboard mapping doesn't work for the ChromeOS specific buttons, for example - they still map to function keys.
- It's specifically unsupported (by name) in google's ChromeOS documentation.
  - Using "Developer Mode" is already unsupported, and can void the
    warranty of your product.
  - Loading a hacky open source github project into a user space virtualization on top of that already unsupported developer mode
shell and using that as your primary operating system is laughably far from official support of any kind.
